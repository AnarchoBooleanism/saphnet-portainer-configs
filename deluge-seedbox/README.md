## Deluge Seedbox
A torrent client for file sharing, behind a VPN, and an SFTP server for accessing these files.

When deploying in Portainer, make sure to set these environmental variables with your secrets:
- `TOKEN` - NordVPN token for account login
- `CONNECT` - Name of NordVPN server to connect to

Make sure, in the `seedbox-files` NFS volume, that there are directories for in-progress downloads, completed downloads, and .torrent files, which should be reflected in the Deluge settings.

Within the `deluge-config` volume, the `auth` file should be modified with the right login info, using the instructions from [this link](https://deluge-torrent.org/userguide/authentication/).

Within the `sftp-config` volume, the `sftp.json` file should be modified with the right login information.
